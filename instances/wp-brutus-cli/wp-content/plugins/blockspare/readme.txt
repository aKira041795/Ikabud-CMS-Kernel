Build blogs, magazines, and business sites with ready-to-use Gutenberg blocks and starter templates. No coding needed.

== Description ==

Creating a professional blog, news or business site can take a lot of time: design, layout, post presentation, and responsive adjustments are all needed before you can launch. Many users want great-looking results but don’t want to write code or build layouts from scratch.

### The BlockSpare approach
BlockSpare provides a library of **starter templates**, **Gutenberg blocks**, and **patterns** so you can assemble production-ready pages quickly. Instead of starting from an empty canvas, start from a thoughtfully designed block or template and adapt it for your brand.

BlockSpare delivers:
* A large starter templates library (industry & niche specific)
* Post presentation blocks (grids, sliders, carousels, masonry)
* Business and utility blocks (pricing, testimonials, counters, CTAs)
* Image & gallery blocks (carousel, masonry, logo grid)
* One-click import and copy/paste patterns for fast builds

This lets you focus on content and customization — not repetitive layout work.
